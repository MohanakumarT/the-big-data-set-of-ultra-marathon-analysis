# the-big-data-set-of-ultra-marathon-analysis
The project enhances skills in data analysis, data cleaning, data visualization, Python programming, and domain knowledge in ultra-marathon running. These skills are crucial in interpreting complex datasets, cleaning and filtering data, visualizing data insights, programming in Python, and understanding the specific domain.

The project you're referring to is a comprehensive exploration of ultra-marathon running events. It's an analytical project that uses Python, pandas, and seaborn data science libraries to analyze a large dataset of over 7.5 million ultra-marathon race records.

Here are the key steps involved in the project:

1. Importing and Exploring Data: The project begins with importing libraries and examining the dataset. The first 10 rows are showcased, and shape and data type checks are performed to set the foundation for further analysis.

2. Cleaning and Filtering: The cleaning process targets USA races with 50km or 50 miles distances in 2020. Information from event names is extracted, athlete ages are calculated, and unnecessary columns are eliminated to refine the dataset.

3. Quality Checks: Data integrity is paramount. Checks for duplicate rows are conducted and a clean dataset is ensured by resetting the index.

4. Data Type Conversion and Column Renaming: Accurate data types are maintained. Athlete age is converted to integers and athlete average speed to floats. Column names are streamlined for clarity.

5. Plotting graphs with Seaborn: Seaborn visualizes key insights. Histograms showcase race lengths, and distributions of athlete average speeds, and violin plots provide a comparative view of athlete average speeds across different races and genders. A scatter plot explores the relationship between athlete age and average speed.

6. Analyzing Seasonal Trends in Athlete Performance: Seasonal trends in athlete performance are explored by categorizing races into seasons and analyzing average speeds. The focus is on 50mi races and average speeds by season are analyzed.

The project is complete and the original dataset, boasting 7.5 million records, holds immense potential for deeper insights. It's a great example of how data analysis can gain insights into specific domains like ultra-marathon running.
